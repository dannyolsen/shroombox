# Controllers and Managers Consolidation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to consolidate the `controllers/` and `managers/` directories in the Shroombox project. The goal was to simplify the project structure by having a single directory for all high-level management and control components.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Import Statements**
   - Updated imports in `main.py` to reference the `managers/` directory
   - Updated imports in `web/web_server.py` to reference the `managers/` directory
   - Updated imports in `managers/environment_controller.py` to reference the `managers/` directory
   - Updated imports in `tests/unit/test_environment_controller.py` to reference the `managers/` directory
   - Updated imports in `scripts/test_temperature_control.py` to reference the `managers/` directory
   - Updated imports in `scripts/test_fan_controller.py` to reference the `managers/` directory

2. **Tested the Application**
   - Verified that the main service was still running
   - Verified that the web service was still running
   - Checked logs for any errors related to imports

3. **Created a Backup**
   - Created a backup of the `controllers/` directory in `backup/controllers_backup/`
   - Verified that all important files were included in the backup

4. **Removed the Controllers Directory**
   - Created a script to safely remove the `controllers/` directory
   - Executed the script to remove the directory
   - Verified that the directory was successfully removed

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `docs/project_structure.md` to reflect the removal of the `controllers/` directory
   - Updated `README.md` to reflect the consolidated structure
   - Created this document to summarize the changes

## Benefits

- **Simplified Project Structure**: The project now has a clearer structure with a single directory for all high-level management and control components.
- **Reduced Confusion**: Developers no longer need to decide whether a component belongs in `controllers/` or `managers/`.
- **Improved Maintainability**: The codebase is now easier to navigate and understand.
- **Aligned with Project Guidelines**: The changes align with the project's structure guidelines, which specify that `managers/` should contain "high-level managers and controllers that coordinate between devices and services."

## Future Considerations

- Consider merging the `api/` directory with the `web/` directory, as the `api/` directory is currently empty except for a routes subdirectory.
- Consider merging the `frontend/` directory with the `web/` directory, as the `frontend/` directory is currently empty except for a structure with src/components and src/services.

## Conclusion

The consolidation of the `controllers/` and `managers/` directories has successfully simplified the project structure and improved its maintainability. All controller functionality is now consolidated in the `managers/` directory, which aligns with the project's structure guidelines.
