# Shroombox Project Structure

This document outlines the organization of the Shroombox project codebase after the cleanup and reorganization.

```

## Directory Purposes

### api/
Contains API endpoints and routes. May be merged with `web/` in the future.

### backup/
Contains backup files, old versions, and deprecated code that might be useful for reference.

### config/
Contains all configuration files for the project:
- `grafana/`: Grafana dashboard configurations
- `services/`: Systemd service files for running the application

### data/
Contains data storage files, databases, and data-related resources.

### devices/
Contains device-specific code for interacting with hardware components.

### docs/
Contains project documentation, including:
- `folder_structure.md`: Documentation about the project structure
- `todo.md`: Todo list for the project
- Other documentation files

### logs/
Contains log files generated by the application.

### managers/
Contains high-level managers and controllers that coordinate between devices and services:
- Environment controllers
- Fan controllers
- Humidity controllers
- Temperature controllers
- Device manager
- Settings manager
- InfluxDB manager

### scripts/
Contains utility scripts for various tasks:
- `cleanup_project.sh`: Script for cleaning up the project structure
- `analyze_directories.sh`: Script for analyzing directory contents
- Other utility scripts

### tests/
Contains test files:
- `unit/`: Unit tests for individual components

### utils/
Contains utility functions and helpers used across the project.

### web/
Contains the web interface and frontend code.

## Key Files in Root Directory

- `main.py`: Main application entry point
- `README.md`: Project overview documentation
- `.env`: Environment variables (also copied to config/.env)
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file

## Naming Conventions

- Script files: `util_*.sh` for utility scripts
- Test files: `test_*.py` for test files
- Service files: `shroombox-*.service` for systemd service files

## Future Improvements

- Consider merging `api/` with `web/` if they contain related functionality
- Consider merging `frontend/` with `web/` if they contain frontend code
- Continue to refine the structure as the project evolves
