# Shroombox Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview

The Shroombox project has been reorganized to follow a more consistent and maintainable structure. This document summarizes the changes made during the cleanup process.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure

The project now follows a more organized directory structure:

```
shroombox3/
├── api/                  # API endpoints
├── backup/               # Backup files and deprecated code
├── config/               # Configuration files
│   ├── grafana/          # Grafana dashboard configurations
│   └── services/         # Systemd service files
├── data/                 # Data storage
├── devices/              # Device-specific code
├── docs/                 # Documentation
├── logs/                 # Log files
├── managers/             # High-level managers and controllers
├── scripts/              # Utility scripts
├── tests/                # Test files
│   └── unit/             # Unit tests
├── utils/                # Utility functions and helpers
└── web/                  # Web interface and frontend
```

### File Movements

1. **Scripts**:
   - Utility scripts were moved to the `scripts/` directory
   - Script naming was standardized with `util_` prefix for utility scripts

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configuration files were moved to the `config/` directory
   - Grafana configurations were moved to `config/grafana/`
   - Service files were moved to `config/services/`

3. **Documentation**:
   - Documentation files were moved to the `docs/` directory
   - `todo.txt` was converted to markdown format as `docs/todo.md`
   - Project structure documentation was created as `docs/project_structure.md`

4. **Tests**:
   - Test files were moved to the `tests/` directory
   - Unit tests were organized in `tests/unit/`

5. **Backup**:
   - Backup and deprecated files were moved to the `backup/` directory
   - Deprecated code was moved to `backup/deprecated/`
   - The mistakenly created `~` directory was moved to `backup/tilde_dir/`

6. **Controllers**:
   - Controller files were moved from `controllers/` to `managers/` directory
   - A README was added to the `controllers/` directory explaining the move

### Directory Merges

1. **Controllers to Managers**:
   - The `controllers/` directory contents were copied to the `managers/` directory
   - The original `controllers/` directory was kept with a README explaining the move

2. **Future Considerations**:
   - The `api/` directory may be merged with `web/` in the future
   - The `frontend/` directory may be merged with `web/` in the future

## Tools Created

1. **cleanup_project.sh**:
   - Script to reorganize files according to the project structure guidelines
   - Moves files to their appropriate directories
   - Creates necessary directories if they don't exist
   - Handles directory merges

2. **analyze_directories.sh**:
   - Script to analyze the structure of directories
   - Provides information about file counts, directory structure, and file types
   - Offers recommendations for potential merges

## Documentation Created

1. **cleanup_plan.md**:
   - Detailed plan for the cleanup process
   - Lists files to move and their destinations
   - Outlines implementation steps

2. **project_structure.md**:
   - Documentation of the new project structure
   - Describes the purpose of each directory
   - Outlines naming conventions and future improvements

3. **cleanup_summary.md** (this file):
   - Summary of the changes made during the cleanup process
   - Overview of the new directory structure
   - List of tools and documentation created

## Next Steps

1. **Update Imports**:
   - Update import statements in code to reflect the new file locations
   - Pay special attention to imports from the `controllers/` directory, which should now be from `managers/`

2. **Test the Application**:
   - Ensure the application still works after reorganization
   - Run tests to verify functionality

3. **Consider Future Merges**:
   - Evaluate whether to merge `api/` with `web/`
   - Evaluate whether to merge `frontend/` with `web/`

4. **Service Files**:
   - Create symbolic links for service files if needed:
     ```bash
     sudo ln -s /path/to/project/config/services/service-file.service /etc/systemd/system/service-file.service
     ```

## Conclusion

The cleanup process has significantly improved the organization of the Shroombox project. The new structure is more consistent, maintainable, and follows established project structure guidelines. This will make it easier for developers to navigate the codebase, find files, and understand the project's architecture.
