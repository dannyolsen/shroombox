# Controllers Directory Removal Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for removing the redundant `controllers/` directory from the Shroombox project. The controller files have already been moved to the `managers/` directory as part of the project reorganization, and now we need to complete the transition by removing the original directory.

## Current Status

- All controller files have been copied to the `managers/` directory
- Most import statements have been updated to reference the `managers/` directory
- The original `controllers/` directory still exists with the original files
- A README was added to the `controllers/` directory explaining that files were moved

## Steps to Remove Controllers Directory

1. **Verify All Imports Are Updated**
   - ✅ Update imports in `main.py`
   - ✅ Update imports in `web/web_server.py`
   - ✅ Update imports in `managers/environment_controller.py`
   - ✅ Update imports in `tests/unit/test_environment_controller.py`
   - ✅ Update imports in `scripts/test_temperature_control.py`
   - ✅ Update imports in `scripts/test_fan_controller.py`
   - Note: Backup files in the `backup/` directory still reference the `controllers/` directory, but these don't need to be updated as they are just backups

2. **Test the Application**
   - ✅ Verify that the main service is still running
   - ✅ Verify that the web service is still running
   - ✅ Check logs for any errors related to imports

3. **Create a Backup of the Controllers Directory**
   - Create a backup of the `controllers/` directory in the `backup/` directory
   - This ensures we can recover the files if needed

4. **Remove the Controllers Directory**
   - Remove the `controllers/` directory and all its contents
   - This completes the transition to using only the `managers/` directory

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Update project documentation to reflect the removal of the `controllers/` directory
   - Ensure all references to controllers point to the `managers/` directory

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after removing the `controllers/` directory:

1. Restore the `controllers/` directory from the backup
2. Revert import changes if necessary
3. Restart the affected services

## Conclusion

Removing the redundant `controllers/` directory will simplify the project structure and make it more intuitive for developers to understand where different components belong. All controller functionality will be consolidated in the `managers/` directory, which aligns with the project's structure guidelines.
