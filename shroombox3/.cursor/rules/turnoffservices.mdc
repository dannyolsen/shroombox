# Service Management Guidelines

This rule ensures proper configuration and management of system services in the Shroombox project.

## Service Configuration
- Configure all services to restart only on failure (`Restart=on-failure`)
- Set appropriate restart delays to prevent rapid cycling (`RestartSec=10s`)
- Use descriptive service names with the `shroombox-` prefix
- Include clear descriptions in service files
- Set proper dependencies between services

## Service Implementation
- Create separate service files for each component
- Use environment files for configuration when appropriate
- Implement proper logging for all services
- Add status reporting capabilities

## Service Management
- Restart affected services after code changes to verify functionality
- Use systemd for service management (start, stop, enable, disable)
- Monitor service status and logs for issues
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures

## Example Service File
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Shroombox Measurement Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=shroombox
WorkingDirectory=/home/shroombox/shroombox3
ExecStart=/home/shroombox/shroombox3/scripts/run_measurements.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Service Deployment
- Use the `install_services.sh` script to deploy services
- Verify service status after installation
- Test service recovery after failure
- Document service dependencies and startup order

## Service Monitoring
- Check service status before and after making changes
- Monitor service logs for errors or warnings
- Implement health checks for critical services
- Set up notifications for service failures
