# Documentation Guidelines

This rule ensures comprehensive and up-to-date documentation throughout the Shroombox project.

## Documentation Types

### Folder Documentation
- Each folder must have a `1FOLDER_DESCRIPTION.md` file explaining:
  - The purpose of the folder
  - What types of files belong there
  - How the files in the folder relate to the overall system
  - Any naming conventions specific to that folder

### Code Documentation
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Include parameter descriptions, return values, and exceptions raised
- Document complex algorithms with explanations of the approach
- Add inline comments for non-obvious code sections

### System Documentation
- Maintain a comprehensive README.md at the project root
- Include setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples
- Document the system architecture and component interactions
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Maintenance Guidelines
- Update documentation whenever code functionality changes
- Review documentation for accuracy during code reviews
- Keep the todo.txt file updated with current tasks and progress
- Document API endpoints with expected inputs and outputs

## Example Docstring Format
```python
def get_measurements():
    """
    Retrieve current sensor measurements.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing (co2_ppm, temperature_celsius, humidity_percent)
              or None if measurements could not be obtained
    
    Raises:
        SensorConnectionError: If the sensor cannot be reached
        CalibrationError: If the sensor is not properly calibrated
    """
```
