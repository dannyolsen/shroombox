# Tapo Smart Plug Integration Guidelines

This rule ensures consistent and reliable integration with TP-Link Tapo smart plugs throughout the Shroombox project.

## Device Identification
- Support finding Tapo plugs by name, not just by IP address
- Maintain a mapping of device names to IP addresses in the settings
- Implement automatic device discovery on the local network
- Handle IP address changes gracefully with periodic rediscovery

## Device Control
- Implement proper error handling for all device operations
- Add retry logic for failed operations with exponential backoff
- Cache device states to reduce unnecessary network requests
- Implement graceful degradation when devices are unreachable

## Configuration
- Allow assigning roles to devices (heater, humidifier, etc.)
- Support custom naming of devices in the user interface
- Provide clear status indicators for device connectivity
- Allow manual override of automatic device control

## Security
- Store device credentials securely
- Implement proper authentication for device control
- Validate all inputs before sending to devices
- Log all device control operations for auditing

## Example Implementation
```python
class TapoDeviceManager:
    def find_device_by_name(self, name):
        """
        Find a Tapo device by its friendly name.
        
        Args:
            name (str): The friendly name of the device
            
        Returns:
            dict: Device information including IP, MAC, etc.
            None: If no device with that name is found
        """
        # Implementation details
        
    def control_device(self, identifier, state, retries=3):
        """
        Control a Tapo device by name or IP address.
        
        Args:
            identifier (str): Device name or IP address
            state (bool): True to turn on, False to turn off
            retries (int): Number of retry attempts if control fails
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if successful, False otherwise
            
        Raises:
            DeviceNotFoundError: If the device cannot be found
            ConnectionError: If connection to the device fails
        """
        # Implementation details
```
