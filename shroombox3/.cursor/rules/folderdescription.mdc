# Folder Description Guidelines

This rule ensures consistent documentation of the project's folder structure.

## Naming Convention
- Name all folder description files as `1FOLDER_DESCRIPTION.md` so they appear first when sorted alphabetically
- Use Markdown format for all folder description files

## Required Content
Each folder description file must include:

1. **Title**: The name of the folder with a brief description
2. **Purpose**: What the folder is used for in the project
3. **File Types**: What types of files should be stored in this folder
4. **Naming Conventions**: Any specific naming patterns for files in this folder
5. **Usage Examples**: How to properly use or interact with files in this folder

## Template
```markdown
# [Folder Name] Directory

This directory contains [brief description of contents and purpose].

## File Types

- `*.py`: [Description of Python files in this folder]
- `*.json`: [Description of JSON files in this folder]
- [Other file types as needed]

## Naming Conventions

Files in this directory follow these naming conventions:
- `[pattern]_*.py`: [Description of what these files do]
- [Other naming patterns as needed]

## Usage Examples

### [Example Name]
```python
# Example code showing how to use files from this directory
```

## Important Notes

- [Any special considerations or warnings]
- [Common pitfalls to avoid]
```

## Implementation
- Create a folder description file in every directory, even if it seems obvious
- Update folder descriptions when adding new file types or changing conventions
- Reference the folder description in code comments when appropriate
